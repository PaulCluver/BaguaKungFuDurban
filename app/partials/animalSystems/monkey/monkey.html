			The Dui or Lake Trigram is represented by the Monkey (h√≥u). The energy of the Monkey is called 'Bao' (Enfolding or embracing) and means that the body contracts in on itself to obtain power. Whether through squatting to the ground and yanking the opponent or through double handed strikes concaving inward or expanding outward, the usage of the hands also ties in with the kicking methods. Consequently, the Monkey system is also known as the 'Lian Huan Tui' or 'Interlocking Leg'. Its eight attacking methods are all kicks.
